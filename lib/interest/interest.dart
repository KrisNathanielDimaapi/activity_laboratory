The system makes it quick and convenient for practitioners to check the latest news and offers, such as research, seminars, and workshops. Practitioners can access the system from any device with an internet connection, saving them time and effort. The system ensures information is current, so practitioners can be confident they\â€™re seeing the latest news and offers. This also gives practitioners the option to register for various membership types and events, such as national conventions, research conferences, and webinars, by simply clicking a responsive button. It is considered a useful tool for practitioners to effectively manage and organize their projects, partnerships, surveys and reports, and also remind them of the upcoming events. The study is necessary for practitioners to see the pattern of their online payment collection for membership fee and action for national board of directors and executive board. Practitioners are driven to achieve better in their activities with the help of this feature.',
